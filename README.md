# Introduction

terminal_snake is a terminal ASCII version of the classic snake game we all know and love. 
There are no package specific dependencies that aren't already taken care of with a normal install of 
python. 

## Dependencies

### Python Version
  python 3.10 and >> will run this game properly in the terminal.

### OS
  This is only structured to run on a Unix OS. I am currently using `wsl`. There are plenty of resources
  out there on how to download `wsl` properly.
